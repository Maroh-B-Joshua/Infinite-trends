    "description":"Price is consolidated in a bullish flag. However price is over sold in the rsi indicator, hence an imminent reversal.",
    "recommendation":"Sell at 20,365, Set stop loss at 21,107, take profit at 17,902",
    "outlook":"Price is very likely to consolidate or retrace at the 17,902. However that's more of a supply than a demand Zone, hence would likely drop further down."
